# moosetools

A repository containing tools originally designed to support MOOSE (www.mooseframework.org). Over the
years the tools evolved into a mature suite of products, as such they were separated into a
stand-alone repository. The "moose" prefix is used for sentimental reasons, the tools presented here
do not require MOOSE.
