    A `Differ` object is expected to be encapsulated by a `Runner` object via the "differs" parameter
    of the `Runner` object. As such, `Differ` objects are designed to be executed from within a
    `TestCase` object. The working directory of this execution is managed by the `TestCase` object
    and defined by the `Runner` object, please refer to the `Runner` documentation for further
    details.
